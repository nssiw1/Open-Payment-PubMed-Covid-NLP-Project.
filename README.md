# Open Payment & PubMed-Covid-NLP-Project.
Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language

Today’s machines can analyze more language-based data than humans, without fatigue and in a consistent, unbiased way

NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important

NLP helps resolve ambiguity in language and adds useful numeric structure to the data for many downstream applications, such as speech recognition or text analytics

Considering the staggering amount of unstructured data that’s generated every day, from medical records to social media, automation will be critical to fully analyze text and speech data efficiently.

Traditional Analyses
Reading summaries/transcripts (i.e. unstructured text) for insights
Subjective approach that may be skewed by human biases
The volume of summary/transcripts today makes this approach impractical, inefficient, and incomplete

The Future is Now
Combining human expertise and natural language processing, Gannett Healthcare Group is able to efficiently scan the summaries/transcripts and identify key topics and themes
More comprehensive, objective, and insightful approach to answering the questions at hand	

Use Artificial Intelligence to quickly derive insight from literature

Heatmaps use Natural Language Processing to illustrate how often terms co-occur

Dark colors show terms and phrases that appear together many times

Drill-down functionality to review the content where the terms appear together

Run PubMed search to produce standard literature grid of titles, abstracts, journals, etc.

Separate each abstract into discreet sentences for a more granular analysis of keywords, statements, and messages

Apply AI keyword extraction functionality to reveal key topics within each sentence

Scientific review to refine the keyword indexing, including:
Merge synonyms and acronyms
Focus on topics of strategic importance
