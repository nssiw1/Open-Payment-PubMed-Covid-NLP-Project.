Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language

Today’s machines can analyze more language-based data than humans, without fatigue and in a consistent, unbiased way

NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important

NLP helps resolve ambiguity in language and adds useful numeric structure to the data for many downstream applications, such as speech recognition or text analytics

Considering the staggering amount of unstructured data that’s generated every day, from medical records to social media, automation will be critical to fully analyze text and speech data efficiently.
